# Introduction
I have attended SNHU since fall of 2018. I have learned many important skills that will help me in my career. Through hard work and a lot of perseverance I have attained a 3.95 GPA. My GPA reflects how hard I work. Through my journey of school, I have worked full time. This means that I have become an expert in managing my time to achieve results to meet deadlines. I also have learned how to learn quickly and efficiently.

# Education
The program at SNHU has taught me valuable skills that I will build upon. Each class that I took taught me useful skills that I will build upon as I reach my goals. I have learned to pay very close attention to detail. Sometimes my code would not run because I had made a typo or misspelled a word. For computer scientists it is important to understand how the software development cycle works. In my CS-250 class I learned how the agile methodology works. I also learned data structures and algorithms from my CS-260 class. I know that databases are extremely important for any project. I learned SQL from my DAD-220 and NOSQL (MongoDB) from CS-340. Throughout my educational experience I also learned how to use GitHub to collaborate in a team project. Everything that I have learned I will build upon and practice to be the best engineer possible.

# Portfolio Summary
Every class and step I took in my educational journey have prepared me for a successful career in tech. Each class taught me many important things and the portfolio is a small reflection of the immense potential that I have. This portfolio has three main artifacts that show my abilities. The first artifact builds upon my IT145 class where I learned about object-oriented programing. I took the final project that was written in Java, and I rewrote the entire project in Python. My second artifact I created a hash table with chaining that lets someone search through real world data. The third artifact I create a visual representation of covid cases and covid deaths using a NoSQL.  Each of the artifacts show cases different skills that are great to have for any project.

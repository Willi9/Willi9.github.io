# 2020 Voting Response Rates for Dallas Texas
The artifact that I have chosen for the algorithm and data structures part of my portfolio is the implementation of a hash table with chaining. This artifact takes data from a CSV file and allows the user to quickly search through the data. 
I included this artifact in my portfolio because hash tables with chaining are one of the most effective and fastest ways to look search through data. 
This artifact shows my knowledge of hash tables and linked lists. It provides an opportunity to show that I know how I can combine two data structure to create a very effective search algorithm.

The original artifact searched faked data that simulated real world scenarios. The way that I improved this artifact was to use more complicated real-world data that would allow someone to search and see Census 2020 response rates from city of Dallas, Texas.
My artifact can help someone search and find response rates in a given date very easily. The artifact shows that I can take real world data and make it easily accessible to someone with the expertise to make sense of the data. 
This article meets the objectives that I planned in Module one. It shows that I understand algorithms and data structures good. 

Throughout the development of this I had fun. The project was a bit more complicated than what it originally was. The data structures of the response rates were more complicated than just fake bid data structures.
As I developed the enhancement for this project, I internalized how structures in C++ work and how chaining worked. I did run into some bugs through development. When I was giving the hashing keys to every entry, I ran into a small bug that would give all entries the same key. 
The way that I fixed this bug was to make the unique keys only numbers and not include any alphabetical or symbol characters. This was a really good developing experience and I enjoyed it.

# Covid Database Mining

The artifact that I chose to develop is from my CS340 class, it is called Animal Shelter. It takes data from an animal shelter and displays the information.
The artifact that I am uploading to my portfolio uses the same techniques as the animal shelter . 
The artifact extracts data from a MongoDB database and displays a pie chart that represents the percentages of cases by race of Covid-19 and a pie chart that represents the percentages of deaths by race of Covid-19.

The artifact is a great artifact to add to my portfolio because it shows my ability to extract and upload data to and from a MongoDB database. It shows that I can extract data and give it meaning.
I can take data and put it in a way that it is very digestible. This project was not so much enhancing, but creating a new project based on the Animal Shelter project.
This project shows the skills that I have previously discussed. I achieved the goal in a different manner than I intended to. 

Through the development of this project was a bit difficult. In the beginning I thought development would go well. This was not the case because I lost the ability to connect to the MongoDB database that was provided to me by SNHU. 
To correct this error, I had to create a MongoDB. At first, I thought I would create a local database, but that would not allow anyone to connect, and I did not have the memory on my laptop. 
This is where I had to learn about MongoDB Atlas. Atlas allowed me to create a database online. The challenge that I now had was that the free version of Atlas does not allow full query statements. 
To get over this challenge I queried very broad which Atlas let me do and used the Pandas python library to get a more specific query. I learned how Atlas operated and how to use pandas more efficiently.
I also learned how Matlabplot works to create subplots and other charts! The development of this project taught me a lot.

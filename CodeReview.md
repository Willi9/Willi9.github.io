# Refinement Plan and Code Review

## Category one: Software Engineering and Design

For the software engineer and design portion I am going to build upon the zoo monitoring project that I completed in IT145: Foundations in Application Development. To enhance this project and show my skills I am going to take this project and transfer everything to a different language. This project is originally written in Java, I will code the entire project in Python. This a great way to show the foundational skills that are needed for object-oriented programming, at the same time show that I can code in different languages. This project shows that I can use the appropriate variable, methods, classes, etc. in multiple languages. These two functions are going to fall under one class so when I run the main program, I can just run the functions. I plan to use tkinter to create popup windows. It’s a very powerful tool that it is used in the industry.

## Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

For the Algorithm and Data Structures portion of the e-portfolio, I am going to build upon the linked list data structures that I learned from my CS260: Data Structures and Algorithms class. To enhance this project, I am going to take real world data (The Response Rate Data for a Census Tract on a given day) and go through and find the response rates for a day using a hash table and chaining. By using a hash table and chaining I demonstrate that I understand the concepts of linked lists and at the same time demonstrate that I know how to implement hash tables. This evident in how I have to make sure that I search in linked list if the hash keys are the same as outlined in the pseudocode. Hash tables are great because they are one of the most effective ways to search through data with the time complexity of searching a hash table being O(n). This enhancement will allow me to show my proficiency with searching algorithms and data structures which are crucial in the Computer Science world. 

## Category Three: Databases
For the databases portion of the e-portfolio, I am going to build a project from scratch the extracts data from a NOSQL database (MongoDB) and gives meaning to the data extracted. I am going to use the final project for the “CS:340 Advanced Programming Concepts” class as a starting point for this project because it taught me how to extract data from a NOSQL database. After I have extracted data, I am going to use the skills that I learned from my class “DAT220: Fundamentals of Data Mining” to provide meaning to the data. This enhancement will showcase my abilities to query databases. This is very important when you are working in any project. This enhancement will show case my skills to give meaning to data and how I can query databases to get the most valuable data. As you can see in my pseudocode, I am going to show the skills I must query for data to provide a small report. I really have to show that I can give meaning to data.

# Python Monitoring 

For the software design and engineering part of my portfolio, I chose to enhance my IT:145 final project created in April of 2019. 
This project is a simple monitoring system that allows you to monitor animals and habitats. 
The user gets asked if they would like to monitor animals or habitats. After they make the initial choice, the user is presented with the different animals or habitats that they can select.
If the habitat/animal selected has a concern the application will create a popup warning window that will alert the user of the concern.

I selected this project to be included in my portfolio because it shows that I understand and can implemented object-oriented skills in various languages. This project shows that I can work with text files.
The enhancement of converting this project from JAVA to Python shows that I understand object-oriented programing well enough to implement it in different languages.
The project also shows my versatility in different languages.
I made the code a lot more versatile, by implementing more functions like the function that displays the warning messages, I have improved the reusability through the enhancement.	
The enhancements that I have made achieve the objectives that I planned in Module one. Although the project is simple. I show my versatility and knowledge by taking the project and transferring it to another language.
I donâ€™t have any update to my plans. My current plan will demonstrate very important skills and this first project is my first step in the plan.

As I was enhancing my project and transferring the artifact from JAVA to Python, I learned a lot. I could not just copy and paste the code from my JAVA project to Python. 
As I modified my project, I noticed that a lot of similarities in how the structure of the project was similar in both languages. I also learned the different method types in python. I learned about the static, class, and instance methods.
Some of the biggest struggles that I had while developing the project in Python was figuring out how to read the text file correctly. 
There are several ways to read the contents of a file in python and I had to go through several strategies until I managed to get the correct behavior from my project.
